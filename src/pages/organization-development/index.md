processTitle: Change Management Coaching Process
process1: We interview key stakeholders in your organization at every level to understand the pitfalls, breakdowns, and issues at a systemic level. We want to know the core concerns and gather the collective wisdom within your organization to develop solutions. We explore what is working well and gain insights about what needs immediate attention and what to prepare for moving forward. We use this analysis as the foundation of the coaching process to provide you with a deeper understanding of the issues and offer actionable suggestions for resolution as well as practices to ensure ongoing success throughout transitions.
