  title: Our core philosophy
  paragraph1: >
    At Resilient Leadership, we believe that you are here to do more than survive. You are a leader, and as such, you will be challenged, you will be put in uncomfortable circumstances and you will upset the status quo. But the question is, who are you being while you are leading?
  paragraph2: >
    Your success as a leader will not be measured by how well you maintained the status quo. It will be measured by the contributions you made. In order to be the biggest contribution available within you, you need to be courageous, wise and resilient.
  quote: >
    “Do not judge me by my success, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.”       
    ~Nelson Mandela

        "Before meeting Charlene, I lived in a perpetual state of self-imposed high expectation and self-criticism. The ability to live in the moment was beyond me. She helped me realize that significant events from my past shaped how I deal with life today.

  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
